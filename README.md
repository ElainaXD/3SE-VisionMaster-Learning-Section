# 3SE-VisionMaster-Learning-Section
The Learning Section for the Computer Vision Group of 3SE Robotics Team, Southeast University.

## Introduction
3SE-VisionMaster-Learning-Section is a project for learning and researching computer vision, aimed at helping team members master relevant technologies and tools.

## Content List
### Paper List
Example:  
- [NeurIPS 2012]Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks[[Paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)]

### Tool List
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): Open Source Computer Vision Library.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library.

### Important Work
#### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It applies a single neural network to the full image, which divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.
